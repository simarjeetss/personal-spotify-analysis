            <h2>Data Retrieval Methods</h2>
            
            <h3>Requesting Access to User Data</h3>
            <p>Spotify allows researchers to request access to specific datasets or subsets of data for research purposes. This method is beneficial when researchers require access to specialized or comprehensive datasets that may not be readily available through other means.</p>
            <p><strong>Process:</strong> Researchers typically need to provide detailed information about their research objectives, the specific data they require, and how they intend to use it. Spotify evaluates each request on a case-by-case basis and may grant access based on factors such as the researcher’s credentials, the relevance of the research, and data availability.</p>
            <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> Once approved, Spotify typically provides access to the requested data within a specified timeframe, which can vary depending on factors such as the volume and complexity of the data.</p>
            <img src="data_request.png" alt="Request Data from Spotify">


            <h3>Real-time Access Using Spotify Web API</h3>
            <p>The Spotify Web API is a powerful tool that allows developers and researchers to programmatically access a wide range of data and functionality from the Spotify platform.</p>
            <p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Accessing the Spotify API requires authentication to ensure secure interactions with user data. The API supports several authentication methods, including Client Credentials Flow, Authorization Code Flow, and Implicit Grant Flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Endpoints:</strong> The API provides various endpoints to interact with Spotify’s music catalog, user data, playlists, and other features. Some common endpoints include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track Endpoints: Retrieve information about individual tracks, such as metadata, audio features, and popularity metrics.</li>
                <li>Artist Endpoints: Access details about artists, including their names, genres, popularity, and related artists.</li>
                <li>Album Endpoints: Retrieve album information, including their name, release date, artists, and track listings.</li>
                <li>Playlist Endpoints: Access details about playlists, including their name, description, track listings, and owner.</li>
                <li>User Endpoints: Retrieve information about Spotify users, including their profile details, playlists, saved tracks, and listening history.</li>
                <li>Search Endpoints: Perform searches across the Spotify catalog for tracks, albums, artists, playlists, and other entities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This method allows for dynamic retrieval of up-to-date data, which can be used for real-time analysis and visualization.</p>
            <img src="realtime.png" alt="realtime access from Spotify web api">

            <h3>Playlist URI Access</h3>
            <p>Spotify assigns a unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to each playlist on its platform. This URI serves as a direct link to the playlist and can be used to programmatically access playlist data.</p>
            <p><strong>Process:</strong> The Playlist URI can be accessed by navigating to the desired playlist within the Spotify application or web interface. Once the playlist is open, the URI can be obtained through the options menu by selecting "Share" or "Copy link to playlist."</p>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Once the Playlist URI is obtained, it can be used to retrieve detailed information about the tracks included in the playlist via the Spotify API by passing the URI as a parameter. This method provides a straightforward and efficient way to retrieve detailed information about the tracks in specific Spotify playlists.</p>
            <p>Below is the code snippet:</p>

            <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
            <h3>Handling Missing Values</h3>
            <p>Before conducting any analysis, it is essential to handle any missing values in the dataset. Missing values can lead to inaccuracies and biases in the analysis. We employed a simple yet effective strategy for managing null values in the dataset:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-r">
                // Check for missing values in each column
                missing_values <- sapply(streaming_history, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
                print(missing_values)
                
                // Impute missing values with the median
                streaming_history$msPlayed[is.na(streaming_history$msPlayed)] <- median(streaming_history$msPlayed, na.rm = TRUE)
            </code></pre>
        
            <h3>Converting Time Data and Calculating Duration</h3>
            <p>Spotify's data includes the duration of track plays in milliseconds, which can be challenging to interpret directly. To make the data more comprehensible, we converted the play duration from milliseconds to minutes.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-r">
                // Convert play duration from milliseconds to minutes
                streaming_history$minutesPlayed <- streaming_history$msPlayed / 60000
            </code></pre>
        
            <h3>Example Code</h3>
            <pre><code class="language-r">
                library(jsonlite)
                
                // Load the dataset
                streaming_history <- fromJSON("path_to_file.json", flatten = TRUE)
                
                // Check for missing values
                missing_values <- sapply(streaming_history, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
                print(missing_values)
                
                // Impute missing values with median for numerical columns
                streaming_history$msPlayed[is.na(streaming_history$msPlayed)] <- median(streaming_history$msPlayed, na.rm = TRUE)

            <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
            <p>We computed three key centrality measures for the network constructed from the user’s
                Spotify streaming history:</p>

            <h3>Degree Centrality</h3>
            <p>The artists with the highest degree centrality can be inter-
                preted as the <strong>favorites</strong> or <strong>go-to</strong> selections for the user. They may also serve as <strong>gateway</strong> artists, introducing the user to new music through related recommen-
                dations.</p>

            <h3>Betweenness Centrality</h3>
            <p>The notable artists in this metric may be considered
                the eclectic connectors within the user’s music tastes. They may not be the most
                frequently played, but they play a critical role in diversifying the user’s listening
                experience.</p>

            <h3>Closeness Centrality</h3>
            <p>The overall closeness of the network suggests a cohe-
                sive listening pattern, where the user exhibits a propensity to keep their musical
                choices within a reachable scope of familiarity.</p>

            <div class="algorithm">
                <h3>Community Detection</h3>
                    <p>Community detection in networks is a crucial analytical approach used to identify clus-
                    ters or groups of nodes that are more densely connected amongst themselves than with
                    the rest of the network. A directed graph is constructed where each node represents an
                    artist from your listening history, and the transitions based on the listening sequence are
                    the directed edges. This means if you listen to one artist and then another, a directed
                    edge connects the first artist to the second. This graph captures the transition of listening
                    sessions, creating a network that reflects your musical journey.</p>
                    <p>Below is the plot:</p>
                    <img src="./plots/community_detection.png" alt="Community Detection Plot">
                    <p>
                        On this directed graph, the Cluster Walktrap algorithm is applied. The algorithm works in the following steps:
                    </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Random Walks:</strong> Short random walks are started at all nodes. The "walk" is essentially a path that randomly moves from one artist to another based on the edges connecting them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Community Structure:</strong> The Walktrap algorithm assumes that walks are more likely to stay within the same community. This is because there are typically more dense connections within a group of similar artists, reflecting a listener’s preference for certain types of music.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Distance Calculation:</strong> The algorithm calculates distances between nodes based on the frequency with which random walks starting at one node end at another. If many walks between two nodes are observed, it implies a close connection, likely within the same community.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering:</strong> It then uses these distances to perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering, starting with each node as its own community and merging nodes step-by-step into larger communities. This merging process continues until it maximizes the modularity of the graph—a measure that quantifies the strength of the division of a network into communities.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>In this project, this method helped identify distinct communities within the Spotify
                        streaming data, highlighting how certain groups of artists are more likely to be listened
                        to together, thereby uncovering patterns that might not be apparent through a simple
                        playlist or genre analysis.</p>
                    <p>Below is another visualization displaying the community detection for the top 20
                        nodes. This selection is based on degree centrality, aimed at reducing the number of
                        nodes for better clarity.
                        The output from the community detection process is visualized as a network plot
                        where nodes are colored based on the community to which they belong. This visual
                        representation provides an immediate sense of the artist clusters within the listener’s
                        Spotify experience.</p>

                <h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>
                <p>Temporal analysis aims to uncover patterns in the timing and duration of music lis-
                    tening sessions. By analyzing the timestamps associated with each song play, we can
                    discern various trends, such as peak listening times, variations in music genre prefer-
                    ences throughout the day, and how listening behavior changes at different hours of the
                    day.</p>
                <p>The endTime field in the Spotify streaming data, which records the timestamp for
                    when a listening session ends, serves as the primary data point for temporal analysis.
                    The first step involves converting these timestamp strings into a more manageable date-
                    time format (POSIXct), which facilitates easier manipulation and analysis within R.
                    Following the time conversion, an aggregation of total listening minutes per hour
                    was executed, employing the dplyr package to group and summarize the data. This aggregation allowed us to construct a dataset representing the cumulative minutes of Spotify usage over each hour, consolidating listening sessions across the entire dataset.</p>
                    <p>The aggregated data was visualized using ggplot2, generating a line graph that de- picts the listening patterns across the 24 hours of a day. The X-axis designates the hour
                        of the day, while the Y-axis quantifies the total listening minutes. The resultant plot
                        reveals the ebb and flow of music consumption, providing a clear visual representation
                        of peak and off-peak listening periods.</p>

                <p>The visual output from the temporal analysis presents a compelling narrative of
                    daily music engagement. The line graph indicates a pronounced peak in listening ac-
                    tivity during the evening hours, suggestive of a predilection for engaging with music
                    towards the end of the day. Conversely, a noticeable decline in activity is observed
                    during the late-night to early-morning hours, indicative of minimal engagement with
                    Spotify during typical sleeping times.</p>

                    <p>This plot illustrates the user's music listening behavior over a 24-hour period. Peaks in listening activity can be observed during specific times of the day, indicating preferred listening times.</p>
                    <img src="./plots/litstening_patterns.png" alt="Temporal Analysis Plot">

                <p><strong>Insight: </strong> Midday shows moderate listening levels, with some fluctuations that may corre-
                    spond to lunch breaks or midday leisure activities. Morning hours display a sharp in-
                    crease, possibly aligning with morning routines or commutes to work or school.</p>

                <p>The analysis of temporal patterns provides an intimate glimpse into the user’s lifestyle
                    and daily routine as it relates to music consumption. The evening peak suggests that the
                    user may utilize music as a form of relaxation and unwinding after the day’s activities.
                    The implications for streaming services like Spotify are manifold; understanding these
                    patterns can inform the curation of time-specific playlists and the timing of new music
                    releases to maximize engagement.</p>

                <h3>Signed Network Analysis</h3>
                <p>In our analysis, we utilized the concept of signed networks to understand better the na-
                    ture of interactions within the artist transition network. Signed networks allow us to
                    assign a positive or negative connotation to each edge based on certain criteria. For our
                    project, we defined positive edges as instances where a song was played to near com-
                    pletion (90 percent or more of its length), suggesting a positive reception. Conversely,
                    negative edges were defined as instances where a song was played less than 10 percent
                    of its total length, indicating disinterest or dislike. The data from Spotify includes de-
                    tails about the tracks you’ve listened to, such as the artist’s name, the track name, the
                    end time of the listening, and the duration of the play in milliseconds.</p>

                <p>We begin by transforming the raw listening duration data into a meaningful inter-
                    action sign. This involves classifying each listening event as a positive or negative
                    interaction based on the percentage of the track’s total duration that was played.</p>
                <img src="./plots/signed_network.png" alt="Signed Network Analysis Plot">
                <p>We classified each listening event based on the play duration of the tracks. Events
                    where a track was played for less than 10 percent of its duration were assigned a neg-
                    ative sign, while those played for more than 90 percent received a positive sign. This
                    classification reflects a listener’s approval or disapproval of a track.</p>

                <p>The rationale behind using such thresholds (90 percent for positive and 10 percent
                    for negative) is to delineate between different levels of listener engagement clearly and
                    to minimize ambiguity in the interpretation of listener behavior. Songs that fall be-
                    tween these two thresholds are not considered in the signed network, as their listener
                    engagement is ambiguous—they are neither clearly liked nor disliked.</p>

                <p>The incorporation of this sign-based approach allows us to dig deeper into the listen-
                    ing habits and preferences, distinguishing between artists that are truly favored versus
                    those that might frequently be skipped or played briefly. This nuanced analysis aids in
                    a more precise community detection within the network.</p>
